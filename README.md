# Quantum-Enhanced-Federated-B2B-Intelligence-Network
Quantum Enhanced Federated B2B Intelligence Network combines federated learning, blockchain, and quantum optimization to enable secure, decentralized, and intelligent collaboration. It enhances demand forecasting, pricing, and supply chain decisions while ensuring privacy and scalability.
Quantum-Enhanced Federated B2B Intelligence Network
a)Problem Statement:
       In B2B systems, data sharing between vendors, retailers, and enterprises is challenging due to:
       Privacy concerns in sensitive business data.
       Lack of real-time intelligence for decision-making.
       Existing federated learning models being limited in accuracy and security.
Solution Idea:
      A Quantum-Enhanced Federated Learning model integrated with blockchain to provide secure, decentralized, and intelligent B2B decision-making.
b) Detailed Proposal & Prototype Plan
       Data Privacy & Security.
       Use Federated Learning (FL) so that data stays with each vendor/retailer.
       Quantum cryptography principles (QKD) for secure communication.
       Blockchain Integration:
       Immutable and transparent record of transactions.
       Smart contracts for automated decision rules.
    Prototype Workflow:
       Vendors upload local data.
       Federated model training happens without sharing raw data.
       Blockchain validates model updates.
       Quantum-inspired optimization boosts accuracy.
c) Features to be Implemented:
       => Federated Learning Model for distributed B2B data.
       => Blockchain layer for secure updates & consensus.
       => Quantum-inspired algorithms for optimization & accuracy.
       => Real-time dashboard for retailers/vendors.
       => Role-based access for different stakeholders.
d)Tech Stack Used:
       Frontend: React.js / Angular
       Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js
       Machine Learning: TensorFlow / PyTorch (for FL)
       Blockchain: Hyperledger Fabric / Ethereum
       Quantum Simulation: Qiskit / Pennylane (for quantum optimization)
       Database: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
       Deployment: GitHub Pages, Docker, or Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)
